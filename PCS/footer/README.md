In this repo, we have the branding of the footer for the PCS

We use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to easily have a dev server running with Hot Module Replacement enabled to enhance development and testing of the configuration.

### How to use ###
First it is needed to clone this repo in your local machine:
`git clone https://%user_name%@bitbucket.org/nformal/booking.git`

Then navigate to that repo and run `npm install` to install all dependencies of the project.

To start the server and see the footer run:
`npm run dev`
This command will start a server in your local machine, normally in the port 3000
